  "objectives": [
    "Propose and implement lightweight 3D decoding heuristics (local pairing, simple clustering) that improve logical error rates.",
    "Explore finite-size effects and threshold-like behavior by sweeping physical error p and lattice size L within tight runtime budgets.",
    "Design clear, layperson-friendly plots (LER vs p curves with annotations; slice montages of defect fields).",
    "Maintain deterministic seeds and CPU-only operation to keep iteration fast and reproducible."

  "constraints": [
    "No heavy dependencies; stick to numpy/matplotlib unless specifically approved.",
    "Keep runtime short (seconds to a couple minutes) by using small L, few p points, and modest trial counts.",
    "Use toy models that are transparent and easy to modify; do not claim hardware relevance.",

  "suggested_improvements": [
    "Compare slice-wise local pairing vs simple 3D clustering; report accuracy-runtime tradeoffs.",
    "Investigate biased noise (X/Z asymmetry proxy) and bias-aware heuristics.",
